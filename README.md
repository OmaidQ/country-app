# Project
Project will return all country information given a country string through the searchbar. The front-end is React and the back-end is NodeJS running Express
I am using the REST Countries API:
```bash
https://restcountries.com/#endpoints-name
```

# Running the project

The project is currently only available locally on a machine, so it must run off your own machine for testing purposes.

1. Clone the repo locally and make sure you have react-scripts installed (npm install react-scripts)

2. Using `cd` (or whatever command your shell uses to mvoe into a directory), move into the `back-end` directory
```bash
cd back-end
```
3. Run the command: 
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. Open up a new terminal and using `cd` move into the `front-end` directory
```bash
cd front-end
```
5. Run the command: 
```bash
npm start
```
6. You should now be re-directed to
```bash
http://localhost:3000/
```
Enter any country's name and appropriate and relevant information from the API will be displayed
